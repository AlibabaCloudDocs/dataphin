# Logical table tasks {#concept_jd1_hhw_chb .concept}

This topic describes the features of the Logical Table Tasks page.

## Basic information {#section_zhd_x1j_dhb .section}

1.  [Enter the Scheduling page](intl.en-US/User Guide/Scheduling center/Overview.md#section_dcr_kpw_chb), and click **Logical Table Tasks** to go to the corresponding page, as shown in the following figure.

2.  On the Logical Table Tasks page, the layout is as follows:
    -   In the left-side navigation pane, you can search for and display logical tables and physical nodes of the logical tables.
        -   In the top of the left-side navigation pane, you can enter a logical table name, conversion task node name, or node ID in the search box to search for nodes. Click the funnel icon on the left side of the search box to filter the logical tables by type. When you search for a logical table node, a node ID is an exact match keyword, whereas a node name and logical table name are approximate match keywords.
        -   The search results are displayed in two layers. The first layer displays a logical table, and the second layer displays the nodes of the logical table. By default, the node type \(displayed as an icon\), node ID, and node name are displayed. All logical tables are listed in alphabetical order.
        -   Move the pointer over a logical table node instance, and the **View Fields** icon is displayed. Click the icon to expand the details and view fields contained in the node, as shown in the following figure.

    -   In the right-side workspace, you can see all nodes of the logical table and their dependencies. In the lower-left corner of the workspace, a thumbnail of the node is displayed.
        -   In the upper-left corner, the name of the current logical table is displayed, you can click the double arrow icon next to it to view the corresponding instances or tasks.
        -   In the upper-right corner, you can click **Refresh** to view the latest relationships between nodes. In the search box, you can also enter a node name or output field name to locate the node in the DAG.
        -   A toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the right-side workspace, you can use it to zoom in or zoom out of the entire DAG or display the DAG in full-screen mode.
        -   You can also drag the DAG to adjust its location. Click a node in the DAG, the detailed information of the node is displayed in the lower-right corner.

## Right-click menus {#section_r5b_t2j_dhb .section}

Right-click a logical table node in the DAG, all supported operations are displayed, as shown in the following figure. With permissions, you can perform operations such as view node scripts, view instances, view recurring tasks, and generate retroactive data.

## Generate retroactive data {#section_y3c_52j_dhb .section}

1.  Right-click a node in the DAG and select **Generate Retroactive Data**, as show in the following figure.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/139467/156134689341024_en-US.png)

2.  The Generate Retroactive Data page appears, as shown in the following figure.

    **Note:** The names of retroactive data generation instances are automatically generated by the system and can be modified by yourself.

3.  Select the date-based timestamps of business data and policies for retroactive data generation, and click **OK** to generate retroactive data. The default option of **Select Downstream Nodes** is **No**. If you select **Yes**, the downstream nodes are displayed. You can select the downstream nodes that require retroactive data generation.

4.  After the retroactive data generation is complete, you can go to the [Retroactive data generation instances](intl.en-US/User Guide/Scheduling center/Instances/Retroactive data generation instances.md#) page to view the generated instances.
