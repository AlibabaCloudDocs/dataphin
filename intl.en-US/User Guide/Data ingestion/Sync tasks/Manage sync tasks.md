-   Change: You can change the task configuration for the source data storage, the target data storage, field synchronization, synchronization limits, and scheduling configuration. For more information, see [Create sync tasks](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data ingestion/Sync tasks/Create sync tasks.md#).
-   Rename: You can rename a sync task.
-   Move: You can move a sync task to a specific folder.

## Publish, unpublish, steal the lock, locate, and delete {#section_pzg_cgk_bhb .section}

By default, a sync task is locked by the user who creates the task. When you have permission to manage sync tasks, and when you change, submit, publish, unpublish, or delete a sync task, the system displays a message saying that you cannot perform the operation and you need to steal the lock first.

When you switch tabs in the workspace, the task list displayed in the left-side navigation page will not change. You can click **Positioning** in the upper right corner to locate the task being modified in the left-side task list.

## Search for and refresh a sync task {#section_kg4_cgk_bhb .section}

On the Sync Tasks page, you can enter a task name keyword in the search box and **search for** a sync task. When you move the pointer over a sync task, you can view the status, the user who created the task, and the task creation time. You can click **Refresh** to refresh the status of each sync task.
