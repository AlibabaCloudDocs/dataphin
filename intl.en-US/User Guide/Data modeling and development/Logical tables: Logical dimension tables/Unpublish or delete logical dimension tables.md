This topic describes how to unpublish and delete a logical dimension table.

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Develop** \> **Standards and Modeling** \> **Logical Dimension Tables**.
2.  In the dimension list in the left-side navigation pane, move the pointer over the dimension you want to unpublish or delete. Click the ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/149433/156134674341498_en-US.png) icon and select **Unpublish** or **Delete**.

    **Note:** 

    -   Logical dimension tables in draft status does not support the **unpublish** operation.
    -   Before you unpublish or delete a logical dimension table, you need to ensure that the logical dimension table is not referenced, the corresponding dimension is not associated with other logical table fields and has no child dimensions. After the logical dimension table is deleted, the corresponding dimension status becomes the draft state.
