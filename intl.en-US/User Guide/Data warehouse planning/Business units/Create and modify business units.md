# Create and modify business units {#task_456479 .task}

This topic describes how to create and modify business units.

A business unit defines a data warehouse namespace and is a systematic conceptual object. When there are significant differences among data in terms of business definition, business units can be created to independently manage each type of business data. Once you have set the business unit to which your project belongs, the subsequent data warehouse building work is restricted within the business unit. One business unit can contain multiple projects. Therefore, the relationship between the business unit and the project is 1: N.

1.  Log on to Dataphin as a super administrator. 

    **Note:** Only the super administrator can create and modify business units.

2.  In the top navigation bar of the Dataphin homepage, choose **Planning**. Alternatively, you can go to the planning page from the **Intelligent Data Warehouse Planning** quick access area.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/148397/156134659441387_en-US.png)


3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Business Units**. In the upper right corner of the page, click **Create Business Unit**.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/367633/156134659448955_en-US.png)


4.  In the **Create Business Unit** dialog box, enter a name, display name, description and select an icon. Click **OK** to complete the creation.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/367633/156134659548959_en-US.png)

 

    **Note:** 

    -   To keep the production environment and the development environment isolated from each other \(dual-environment mode\), one business unit is generated for each environment. Therefore, two business units are generated by default through one-time business unit creation. The name of the business unit in the development environment is suffixed with **\_dev** by default.
    -   Business unit names are prefixed with **LD\_** by default. Therefore, project names cannot have this prefix. This allows the system to distinguish between logical tables and physical tables. When logical tables and physical tables are referenced, logical table names are prefixed with the corresponding business unit name, while physical table names are prefixed with the corresponding project name. If project names also start with LD\_, then physical table names will be prefixed with LD\_, and the system cannot distinguish physical tables from logical tables.
5.  Modify the business unit. After creating a business unit, you can click **Change** icon to modify the business unit.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/367633/156134659548971_en-US.png)


6.  In the **Change Business Unit** dialog box, change the name, display name, icon, or description. Click **OK** to save your changes.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/367633/156134659548974_en-US.png)

 

    **Note:** When logical tables exist in a business unit, changing the **Common English name** is not supported. This prevents accidental name changes, which may result in serious consequences.
