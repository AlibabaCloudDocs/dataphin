# Create business filters {#concept_n3c_gh4_fhb .concept}

An atomic metric is the standardized definition of computing logic, and a business filter is the standardized definition of a query condition. Dataphin specifies that each business filter is unique within a business unit and created based on a source logical table. The computing logic is clearly defined based on the fields of the source logical table. This helps to ensure that all statistical metrics are constructed in a unified and standard manner. A business filter may be defined by multiple logical tables belonging to different data domains. Therefore, a business filter may belong to multiple data domains.
