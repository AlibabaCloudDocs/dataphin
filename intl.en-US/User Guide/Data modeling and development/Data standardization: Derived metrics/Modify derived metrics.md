# Modify derived metrics {#concept_lwr_5rz_2hb .concept}

This topic describes how to modify a derived metric.

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Develop** \> **Standards and Modeling** \> **Derived Metrics**.
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, locate the derived metric to be modified, and click the More icon. Choose **Change** to open the Change Derived Metric page.

    **Note:** 

    -   Only the basic information can be modified. You cannot change other information such as computing logic for a derived metric.
    -   If you want to change the elements that are configured for a derived metric, such as a business filter, you must create a new derived metric. In this case, you can create a derived metric with the corresponding elements, ensuring that the definitions of the derived metric is standardized and unambiguous. The computing logic of the derived metrics will be updated based on the updates of the elements' computing logic.
3.  Modify the basic information of a derived metric, save, and then publish the derived metric.

    **Note:** A derived metric name must be unique in a logical aggregate table. The logical aggregate table is determined by the statistic granularity, such as a dimension or a combination of dimensions.
