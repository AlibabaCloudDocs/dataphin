# Data assets overview {#concept_ivw_krk_bhb .concept}

After data acquisition, integration, processing, and other development works are complete, you can manage the data on the Data Assets page in a systematic way.

Based on the standards and methodology of data asset management, Dataphin can check and assess the data assets, including:

-   Extracts and analyzes metadata automatically, and constructs data assets visually, allowing managers to understand the value of data assets.
-   Data production provides an end-to-end inventory check and analysis of computing, storage, security, and applications. This helps you to discover problems, propose and implement governance optimization solutions, reducing costs and improving efficiency at the data layer. You can access the Data Assets page to view the results of data modeling and development, as well as the data table details.

## Go to the Data Assets page {#section_h3b_2wk_bhb .section}
