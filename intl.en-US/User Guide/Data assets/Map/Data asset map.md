# Data asset map {#concept_cls_tpk_bhb .concept}

By aggregating the relationships between dimensions and business processes in a data domain of a business unit, the data structure is displayed and corresponds to the asset overview. Besides, the asset map also provides efficient, fast, and accurate data search and exploration based on your certain behaviors, such as searches, visits, and bookmarks.

[Go to the Data Assets page](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data assets/Data assets overview.md#section_h3b_2wk_bhb), select **Map** to open the asset map page, as shown in the following figure.

The page contains the following four sections: search bar, business units, my data assets, and recommended data assets.

## Search bar {#section_ugs_lfq_bhb .section}

You can search for tables by name, display name, and description. Autocomplete function is supported. By default, when you enter search content in the search box, 10 relative tables and 10 relative keywords matched to the search content are displayed below the search box. You can see table names, table display names, and descriptions of the relative tables. You can also select development environment or production environment in the drop-down list to search for tables in different environments, as shown in the following figure. If you select a matched table, you will go to the table details page. If you select a relative keyword, the search results will be updated based on the keyword.

## Business units {#section_d4j_4fq_bhb .section}

The Business Units section follows the search bar. In this section, the division of information echoes the asset map, and only displays the data of the production environment, including the business units, data domains, dimensions, and business processes.

Dimension names are displayed under Dimensions, and business process names are displayed under Business Processes. You can select a dimension or business process to open the details page of the associated tables. On the page, the filtering conditions are automatically selected.

This section displays the data asset history that you accessed and the data asset bookmarks that you added. By default, the production environment data is displayed. However, you can check the data in the development environment by selecting the development environment radio button.
