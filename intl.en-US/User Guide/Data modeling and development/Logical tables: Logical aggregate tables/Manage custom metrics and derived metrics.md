# Manage custom metrics and derived metrics {#concept_gyn_3b1_fhb .concept}

This topic describes how to manage derived metrics \(such as create, delete, and edit derived metrics\) on the Logical Aggregate Tables page, as well as how to create custom metrics.

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Develop** \> **Standards and Modeling** \> **Logical Aggregate Tables** to open the corresponding page.
2.  **Manage derived metrics** 

    In the left-side navigation pane, select logical aggregate table to open the workspace where you can manage derived metrics. The main operations include create, delete, modify derived metrics, view derived metric details, and other operations.

3.  **Create custom metrics** 

    Besides derived metrics, you can also create custom metrics. Custom metrics are created by adding existing metrics to the physical tables that are in the current project and whose owner is the current user. To add a custom metric, follow these steps:

    1.  Select the **Custom Metrics** tab, click **Create Custom Metric**.
    2.  In the dialog box that appears, enter the required information, and then click **OK** to create a custom metric.
