# Before purchase {#concept_qgs_4sx_dhb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud carefully considers each request for a Dataphin refund. We recommend that you carefully read the terms and conditions before purchasing the service. If a refund is approved after the purchase, your service usage fees will be deducted from your refund.

Note that in the beta phase, the number of customers who can purchase Dataphin is limited. We recommend that you contact Alibaba Cloud customer sales team and provide the data construction requirements and background information of your enterprise. Then, you can determine whether Dataphin's functions and version meet specific your requirements. If Dataphin meets your requirements, communicate with the sales team to obtain the purchase permission.
