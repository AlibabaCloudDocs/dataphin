# Generate retroactive data {#concept_gjq_qk5_zgb .concept}

To verify that code and tasks are valid and normal, you can manually initiate a retroactive data generation task and perform data verification. After you have developed a logical dimension table, a logical fact table, or a logical aggregate table, the system automatically generates a logical table conversion task. You can use the same method to generate retroactive data for the logical table conversion task of each type of logical table. The following uses the logical table conversion task of your logical dimension table as an example to demonstrate how to generate retroactive data and perform data verification.

## Initiate a retroactive data generation task {#section_qcf_k21_1hb .section}

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Scheduling** \> **Recurring Tasks** \> **Logical Table Conversion Tasks**. Click the logical table conversion task created for your logical dimension table, as shown in the following figure.
