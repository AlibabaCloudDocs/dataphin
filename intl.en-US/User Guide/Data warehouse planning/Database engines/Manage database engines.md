# Manage database engines {#concept_qlr_rst_2hb .concept}

After a database engine is created, the super administrator and database engine creator can run a connectivity test on the database engine. If an error occurs while performing a synchronization task, a connectivity test can be used to check whether the error is caused by database engine connection problems. If the database engine is not correctly connected, the super administrator or the database engine creator needs to modify the connection configurations and ensure they are valid. The super administrator and creators can also perform operations such as delete database engines, modify connection configurations, and transfer ownership. The user interface is shown in the following figure.
