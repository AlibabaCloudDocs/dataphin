# Overview {#concept_exl_wys_2hb .concept}

A project is used to isolate physical resources and developers during Data Mid-End construction. A business unit can contain multiple projects, and each system member can join multiple projects.

You must set the computation configuration before managing the project If you have not set the computation configuration, set it on the **Management Center** \> **Computing Engine Configuration** page. For more information about how to set the computation configuration, see [Set the computation configuration](intl.en-US/User Guide/Management Center/Set the computation configuration.md#).

On the **Project Management** page, you can view all projects and the projects you have joined. For a specific project that you have joined, you can view its information settings and project members. You can also go to the workbench of the project. You need to set an IP whitelist for each project to allow scheduled tasks to access resources at the corresponding IP addresses. This ensures the security of scheduling.

You can filter projects to view projects that belong to a specific business unit. You can also sort projects by the date when each project is created, project display name, and project name. The project list can be displayed in **List Mode** or **Pairing Mode**. In pairing mode, projects cannot be filtered or sorted.
