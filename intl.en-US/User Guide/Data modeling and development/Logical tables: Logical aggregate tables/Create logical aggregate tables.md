# Create logical aggregate tables {#concept_v1n_1xz_2hb .concept}

A logical aggregate table consists of a specific analysis object \(such as a member\) and relative statistical metrics. Statistical metrics that constitute a logical aggregate table share the same statistic granularity \(such as a member\). The aggregate logic provides all statistics data of a theme-based statistic granularity \(such as a member\). Therefore, Dataphin also supports theme-based data query.

You can collect statistical metrics to form a logical aggregate table with the following two methods: Note: Based on this construction principle, the logical aggregate table only has the **Submitted** status.

-   The system aggregates data based on the same statistic granularity by default.
-   According to the same primary key principle, common physical table fields that are created by non-derived metrics are added to the corresponding logical aggregate tables.

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Develop** \> **Standards and Modeling** \> **Logical Aggregate Tables** to open the corresponding page.
2.  You can open the logical aggregate table creation page by clicking one of the three icons in the following figure.

    **Note:** After the derived metrics are submitted, a new logical aggregate table is generated by default.
