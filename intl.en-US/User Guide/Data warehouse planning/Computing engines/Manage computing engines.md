# Manage computing engines {#concept_hqd_lvt_2hb .concept}

After a computing engine is created, the super administrator and computing engine creator can run a connectivity test on the computing engine. If an error occurs while performing a sync task, a connectivity test can be used to check whether the error is caused by computing engine connection problems. If the computing engine is not properly connected, the super administrator or the computing engine creator needs to modify the connection configurations and ensure that they are valid. The super administrator and creators can also perform operations such as delete computing engines, modify connection configurations, transfer ownership, and create projects. The user interface is shown in the following figure.

After a computing engine is created, the computing engine type cannot be changed. The computing engine that has already been assigned to a project cannot be deleted. We do not recommend that you configure the same connection information for a computing engine and a database engine. If a computing engine and a database engine have the same connection information, check that your scenario allows for such a configuration before you continue to create projects.
