# Code editor {#concept_dl3_5vb_fhb .concept}

This topic introduces the Dataphin code editor.

The Dataphin code editor provides precise syntax prompts, syntax completion, and syntax error correction functions by analyzing user input and constructing an abstract syntax tree \(AST\). The code editor also integrates with metadata to make UDF details and table details traceable with one click, providing an intelligent and immersive development experience. Supports standard SQL and other syntaxes, such as Shell and Python.
