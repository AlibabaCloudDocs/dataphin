This document guides you through the complete process of how to build a data warehouse.

To build a data warehouse, you need to define standards for data, and then start data development based on the predefined standards. When defining standards, you need to specify your business hierarchy and domains and manage data standards within each layer and domain. Data development involves data ingestion, dimension table development, fact table development, aggregate table development, and data verification. The following describes how to complete each step.

**Note:** If you are using Dataphin for the first time, make sure that you have an account, a project, and a role in your project. Then, log on to the Dataphin console and go to the Dataphin homepage. In the **Projects** section, select your project and click **Enter Workbench** to start data development.

This document uses the development of a dimension table as an example to help you learn more details about the data development procedure. The procedure includes the following steps:

-   [Develop a dimension table](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Develop a dimension table.md#)
-   [Generate retroactive data](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Generate retroactive data.md#)
-   [Verify data](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Verify data.md#)
