In Management Center, the super administrator can **manage members** and **set the computation configuration**. This is a prerequisite for using Dataphin.

To set the computation configuration, the super administrator needs to select the computing engine type, and configure cluster and metadata settings. Member management operations include view member information, add members, and delete members. All users can view information in Management Center. However, only the super administrator can perform operations, such as configure, add, and delete.

This chapter describes how to set the computation configuration and manage members as the super administrator.
