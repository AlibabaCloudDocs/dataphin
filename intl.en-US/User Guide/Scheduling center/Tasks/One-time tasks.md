2.  On the One-time Task Instances page, all one-time tasks are displayed by default in descending order of update time.
    -   Similar to the Recurring Tasks page, In the left-side navigation pane, you can search for and display one-time tasks. By default, the node type \(displayed as an icon\), node ID, node name, and update time are displayed. The search results of all nodes are displayed in the descending order by update time.
    -   The right-side workspace of one-time tasks is very different from workspace of recurring tasks. In the right-side workspace, the detailed information of one-time task nodes and supported operations are displayed. At the top of the right-side workspace, the one-time task instance status of the current node is displayed. If the one-time task node has not been run, the status is displayed as **Not Running**. Below the detailed information, it shows the supported operations, including run task nodes, view operations logs, view instances, and edit nodes. The main part of the right-side workspace is used to display the task scripts of the current node.

## Search and filter one-time tasks {#section_ngn_kxb_dhb .section}

The search and filter feature for one-time tasks is similar to those for recurring tasks. For more information, see [Recurring tasks](intl.en-US/User Guide/Scheduling center/Tasks/Recurring tasks.md#).
