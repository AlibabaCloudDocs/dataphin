This topic introduces the Dataphin console.

1.  Log on to the [Dataphin console](https://dataphin.console.aliyun.com/workingArea?accounttraceid=faf7fb35-e1d6-403f-b727-d195f4c90e6e) by using your Alibaba Cloud account.
2.  Go to the Dataphin console.
    -   If your Alibaba Cloud account shows that you have not purchased Dataphin, or your subscription has expired for less than 15 days, the console displays detailed service status information. Click **Buy Now** or **Renew Now** to purchase or renew Dataphin. For more information, see [Purchase and renew Dataphin](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Purchase and renew Dataphin.md#).

        **Note:** RAM users can view your account's service status information after logging on to the console. However, RAM users cannot purchase or renew services. Only Alibaba Cloud accounts are authorized to perform these operations.

    -   If your Alibaba Cloud account has purchased Dataphin, and your subscription has not expired, you can use Dataphin after you log on to the console.
