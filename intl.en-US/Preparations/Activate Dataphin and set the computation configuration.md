This topic describes how to activate Dataphin and set the computation configuration.

## Activate Dataphin {#section_ad5_k3o_6xu .section}

Currently, Dataphin does not support trial use. Please purchase Dataphin before using it. For more information about the purchase method, see [Purchase and renew Dataphin](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Purchase and renew Dataphin.md#).

## Set the computation configuration {#section_cxa_3ur_az0 .section}

Currently, the public cloud version of Dataphin only supports MaxCompute computing engines. We recommend that you use the MaxCompute version released in December 2017 if you want to run Spark tasks on MaxCompute. We do not recommend that you use the MaxCompute version released before December 2017 because the earlier version does not support Spark tasks.

For more information about how to set the computation configuration, see [Set the computation configuration](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Management Center/Set the computation configuration.md#).
