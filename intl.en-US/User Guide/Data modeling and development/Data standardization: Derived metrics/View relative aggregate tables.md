# View relative aggregate tables {#concept_esm_lvz_2hb .concept}

This topic describes how to view relative aggregate tables of a derived metric.

1.  Choose **R&D** \> **Develop** \> **Standards and Modeling** \> **Derived Metrics**.
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, locate and click a derived metric. In the right-side navigation pane that appears, you can see the **View Relative Aggregate Tables** button.
3.  Click **View Relative Aggregate Tables** to go to the details page of the logical aggregate table to which the derived metrics belongs. The logical aggregate table is determined by the statistic granularity.

    You can create, edit, and delete metrics, view details, and manage metrics in different tabs. You can also create custom metrics. For more information, see [Manage custom metrics and derived metrics](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data modeling and development/Logical tables: Logical aggregate tables/Manage custom metrics and derived metrics.md#).
