# Recurring tasks {#concept_ty2_1hw_chb .concept}

This topic describes the features of the Recurring Tasks page.

## Basic information {#section_vqf_fp1_dhb .section}

1.  [Enter the Scheduling page](intl.en-US/User Guide/Scheduling center/Overview.md#section_dcr_kpw_chb), and the **Recurring Tasks** page is displayed by default, as shown in the following figure.

    **Note:** To distinguish between tasks created by yourself and tasks automatically generated by the system, recurring tasks are categorized into code & sync tasks and logical table conversion tasks. For example, you can view the sync tasks created by yourself on the Code & Sync Tasks tab of Recurring Tasks page.

2.  On the Recurring Tasks page, the tasks are displayed in descending order based on the update time, and the first task is automatically selected by default.
    -   In the left-side navigation pane, you can search for and display recurring tasks. By default, the node type \(displayed as an icon\), node ID, node name, and update time are displayed. The search results of all nodes are displayed in descending order based on the update time.
    -   In the right-side workspace, you can see the DAG with the selected instance as the central node, and both upstream and downstream instance nodes at the first level. In the upper-right corner, you can click **Refresh** to view the relationships between the latest instance nodes. You can also search for nodes in the current DAG by node ID or name. A toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the right-side workspace, you can use it to zoom in or zoom out of the entire DAG, display the DAG in full-screen mode, and set the layers of DAG to be displayed by default. You can also drag the instance to adjust the location of the DAG. After you select a node, the detailed information of the node is displayed in the lower-right corner of the DAG.

## Search and filter recurring tasks {#section_vtb_gp1_dhb .section}

-   **Standard search and filter** 

    In the left-side navigation pane, you can enter the node name or node ID to search for instances. You can also select **My Nodes** and **Publish Today** to quickly filter specific nodes. When you search for a recurring task, a node ID is an exact match keyword, while a node name is an approximate match keyword.

-   **Advanced search and filter** 

    Click the funnel icon on the left side of the search box, an advanced search box appears, as shown in the following figure. You can filter search results based on task owners and task types.

## Right-click menus {#section_l4m_4rb_dhb .section}

Right-click a recurring task node in the DAG, and all supported operations are displayed, as shown in the following figure. With permissions, you can perform the following operations: show parent nodes, show child nodes, view node script, edit node, view operations log, change owner, view instances, and generate retroactive data.
