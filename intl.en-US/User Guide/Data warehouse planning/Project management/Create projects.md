# Create projects {#task_645329 .task}

This topic describes how to create projects.

-   Only the super administrator can create projects.
-   A computing engine source must be assigned to each project. We recommend that you create a computing engine before creating a project. For more information about computing engine source configuration, see [Create computing engines](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data warehouse planning/Computing engines/Create computing engines.md#).
-   A computing engine source can only be assigned to one project, and vice versa. After a computing engine source is assigned to a project, it cannot support to change the computing engine source assigned.

1.  Log on to Dataphin as a super administrator.
2.  In the top navigation bar of the Dataphin homepage, choose **Planning**. Alternatively, you can go to the planning page from the **Intelligent Data Warehouse Planning** quick access area.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/148397/156134662641387_en-US.png)


3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Project Management**. In the upper right corner of the page, click **Create Project** to open the project creation dialog box. ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/519133/156134662649226_en-US.png)

 

    **Note:** In dual-environment mode, one project is generated for each environment, to keep the production environment and the development environment isolated from each other. Therefore, two projects are generated by default through one-time project creation. The name of the project in the development environment is suffixed with **\_dev** by default.

4.  In the **Create Project** dialog box, configure the project information. 
    1.  Configure the **Name settings** and **Project settings**.![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/519133/156134662649236_en-US.png)

 

        **Note:** 

        -   When your computing engine type is MaxCompute, we recommend that you use the MaxCompute project name as your project name.
        -   If the system displays a message stating that the specified computing engine is the same as the computing engine assigned to another project, check the configuration before continuing. Such configuration may cause data write conflicts in the specified computing engine.
        -   If the computing engines created in Dataphin correspond to different MaxCompute projects, check whether your AccessKey has the project administrator privileges for each MaxCompute project or has permission to access different MaxCompute projects. If your AccessKey does not have the preceding permissions, copy the code in **Authorization Code** and go to the MaxCompute console to grant permissions to your AccessKey by using the code. The authorization will prevent database authentication failures from occurring during cross-project access.
        -   Project names cannot start with **LD\_** because business unit names start with **LD\_**. This allows the system to distinguish between logical tables and physical tables. When logical tables and physical tables are referenced, logical table names are prefixed with the corresponding business unit name, while physical table names are prefixed with the corresponding project name. If project names also start with LD\_, then physical table names will be prefixed with LD\_, and the system cannot distinguish physical tables from logical tables.
    2.  Configure the **Namespace**. In the **Namespace** section, the selection of a **Business Unit** is optional. If you do not select a business unit, you cannot define standards or develop logical table models in the R&D workbench. You can only write scripts manually. Select a **Project Type** to categorize development tasks in the project and their data output. The default project type is the application data store layer. 

        **Note:** There are the following project types:

        -   Source data layer: This layer stores the raw data from each businesses' database. This layer is the data source and basis for subsequent data construction.
        -   Common dimensional modeling layer: In this layer, you define common themes based on data of each type of business and create dimensions and business processes to generate logical tables. This layer connects the source data layer and the application data store layer.
        -   Application data store layer: In this layer, you can define personalized and diverse metrics and business filters that can be used to produce data for different business scenarios.
    3.  Configure the **Sandbox whitelist**. Click **Create**, enter IP address and port, click ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/519133/156134662649260_en-US.png).![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/519133/156134662749258_en-US.png)


5.  After the preceding information is configured, click **OK** to complete the project creation.
