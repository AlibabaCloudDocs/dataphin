# Manage logical table conversion task settings {#concept_cfc_ct4_fhb .concept}

This topic describes how to manage the logical table conversion task settings. Before the logical dimension tables automatically generate code and are converted into physical tables, you need to set the retention period and partitioning field based on your business scenarios.

1.  [Go to the logical table editing page](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data modeling and development/Logical tables: Logical dimension tables/Configure logical models and tables.md#section_ysx_sb3_fhb), and select **Logical Table Conversion Task Settings** tab on the page. In the window that appears on the right side of the page, you can configure relevant information according to the interface prompt. The partitioning fields cannot be same as the columns to exclude for conversion.
2.  After the logical dimension table is published, the code of the logical dimension table is automatically generated and is periodically scheduled in the background. To publish a logical table, you must have permissions of a project production account instead of a personal development account. You also need to have the permission to manage the table.
