# Overview {#concept_dhw_z3f_2hb .concept}

The first step of Data Mid-End construction based on Dataphin is data warehouse planning. This is an important step for the architectural design of your data system.

Data warehouse planning concerns the architectural design of logical and physical spaces. The design facilitates categorizing businesses and managing resources and projects.

-   Logical spaces are namespaces and core objects defined based on business characteristics. Logical spaces include business units, data domains, and common business logic.
-   Physical spaces consist of projects and data sources that are created to meet many high requirements of development, collaboration, and management.

## Go to the Planning page {#section_w3j_zf1_hhb .section}

In the top navigation bar of the homepage, choose **Planning**. Alternatively, you can go to the Planning page from the **Intelligent Data Warehouse Planning** quick access area.

Data warehouse planning involves defining businesses, projects, and data sources. You need to first configure a data source \(computing engine\) and assign the data source for a project to provide storage and computation resources for the project. Then you need to add the project to a business unit. On the Planning page, you can configure and manage businesses, projects, and data sources. The objects you have already created and all your configurations on this page are the basis for the construction of Data Mid-End.
