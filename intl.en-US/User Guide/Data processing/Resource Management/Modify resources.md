4.  In the dialog box that appears, modify description, re-upload the file, and then click **Submit**.

    **Note:** The size of the uploaded file is not limited. However, if the network connection is unstable, we do not recommend that you upload a file that is larger than 10 MB. By default, you can upload the following resource types: File, JAR, Python, and other file types. The maximum size of each file is 50 MB. If the file is referenced by a function, you need to submit the function again after the file is updated. Otherwise, the file referenced by the function will not be updated.
