# Create computing engines {#concept_rgs_hvt_2hb .concept}

A computing engine is a database with computing capabilities. A computing engine must be assigned to each project. A computing engine is used to perform computations and store the physical tables generated by converting the published logical tables and running published code tasks and ad hoc queries. Before creating a computing engine, you must have set the computation configuration. The data source type of a computing engine must be the same as the computing engine type specified in your computation configuration.

## Computing Engines page {#section_lrq_kyt_2hb .section}

The Computing Engines page displays the current computing engine type and the Change button. You can click **Change** to go to **Management Center** where you can change your computation configuration.

As shown in the following figure, the Computing Engines page displays information about all connected computing engines. The information includes computing engine name, creation information, connection information, and the project to which each computing project is assigned. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can filter the computing engines based on **whether they are assigned to projects**. You can also search for a computing engine by name.

## Procedure {#section_jxf_lyt_2hb .section}

1.  Log on to Dataphin.
2.  In the top navigation bar of the Dataphin homepage, choose **Planning**. Alternatively, you can go to the planning page from the **Intelligent Data Warehouse Planning** quick access area.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Computing Engines**, then click **Create Data Source** in the upper-right corner of the page.

4.  The computing engine type and the **endpoint** can only be modified by the super administrator in **Management Center**. When users who are not the super administrator create computing engines, they can customize computing engine information, such as name, description, and connection. Except for special scenarios, we do not recommend that you create multiple computing engines that have the same connection information. We do not recommend that you allow other products to write to your computing engines. This prevents write conflicts and errors from occurring in your database.

    The following figure shows the page for creating a MaxCompute computing engine.

    **Note:** 

    -   You must specify a MaxCompute project that belongs to the current Alibaba Cloud account.
    -   To ensure a successful computing engine connection, we recommend that you set an AccessKey that has the highest level of permissions for the specified MaxCompute project. You cannot change the MaxCompute project name of a computing engine if the computing engine is assigned to a Dataphin project.
    -   We do not recommend that you change the AccessKey. If the new AccessKey has limited permissions for the MaxCompute project, it may result in the following problems:
        -   Metadata errors.
        -   The error indicating that the metadata does not exist occurs during code task execution, ad hoc queries, and data modeling.
        -   Data assets are unavailable.

5.  Click **Test Connection** to run a connectivity test. If the message **The data source is connected** is returned, the test is passed. Click **Submit** to complete the creation of the computing engine.
