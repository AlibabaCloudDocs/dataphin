# Overview {#concept_gtn_1kv_fhb .concept}

Data modeling and development are implemented based on the data warehouse concept. Dataphin provides systematic modeling and development functions. During data modeling and development, you can define dimensions and business processes, and further create dimension tables, fact tables, aggregate tables, the application data store layer, and the common dimensional model layer. This facilitates the use of layered business data and optimizes computing and storage.

## Go to the R&D page {#section_exx_vkv_fhb .section}

Choose **R&D** in the top navigation bar of the homepage. Alternatively, open the R&D page from the quick access area for the R&D workbench, as shown in the following figure.

On the R&D page, an **operation guide** is provided to show the relationship between dimensions, business processes, business filters, atomic metrics, derived metrics, logical dimension tables, logical fact tables, logical aggregate tables, and other development operations. For more information, see [Functions and usage guidelines](intl.en-US/User Guide/R&D page structure.md#section_sr2_j1k_dhb).

In the left-side navigation pane, task information such as the development status can be displayed when you move the pointer over a task, as shown in the following figure.

Before you start data modeling and development, ingest external data to the data source that is bound to your project. For more information about the **data ingestion** module, see [Create synchronization target tables](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data ingestion/Create synchronization target tables.md#).

Dataphin is in the beta phase. Therefore, intelligent development is supported only in the China \(Shanghai\) region on the China site. A maximum of 200 data processing units are supported. For more information about pricing, see [Billing](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing.md#).
